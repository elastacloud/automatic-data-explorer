Description: This package will automatically generate a 'Data Exploration Report' which will 
    have separate sections presenting the findings (e.g. data structure section, univariate 
    section, multivariate section, 'cleanliness' report). Presentation is very important to us, 
    so readability and quality of visualisations within the report will be paramount.
